1) Make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code and Python downloaded properly
   - https://www.python.org/downloads
   - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

2) Open the folder in Visual Studio Code and open a terminal (Ctrl+Shift+`)

3) Run pip install telethon 

4) Get your API ID and HASH from https://my.telegram.org/

5) Put your username, API ID, API Hash, the link of the message you want forwarded and the time interval in seconds in the config.json file

6) Put all of your channel links in channels.txt, with one channel per line
   - For topics, make sure it is in this format - https://t.me/channelname/topicnumber

7) Run script.py with py script.py

Note:
Make sure you use an aged telegram account, preferably used, if you want to forward to multiple channels at once. I will not be responsible for accounts being deleted.
